# autorecon
A simple script that automated the process of reconnaissance by scanning for live network hosts and then subsequently kicking off service specific scans

## Usage
```./recon.sh <IP/CIDR>```

## Prerequisites
You will need the following installed:
* NMAP
* gobuster
* WhatWeb

Note: If you are running on the latest rolling Kali, you will have these.

## TODO
* Implement more robust service scanning on live hosts
* Implement better bulk service output for data organization
